# Benson Boone – Cry

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I tried to hide it through
the silence while I played along
I'm welling up behind my eyelids
when I'm holding on
To the reigns,
so badly I hate it
And I wish that all of—
Nah, nah, nah,
that doesn't feel right
Maybe, uh, speed it up
Yeah, that's nice
I really hate the way you
think that you can get away
By blaming all your stupid
problems on your mental state
I'm tired of burnt-out lies, oh
Ooh
You think you know me,
but you hardly even
know yourself
I'd bite my tongue and
let you think I only
wish you well
I don't, I know you know it
Ooh
And I'm tired of letting

so go ahead and
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone
else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else,
so I can sleep at night
Mmm, you're more narcissistic
than anybody in Hollywood
You're not a misfit,
don't keep sayin'
you're misunderstood
I'm tired, oh,
I'm so tired, oh
Ooh
And maybe you're the honest type
And it's been me the whole
damn time
I should really try to calm
my mind and see things
from your side
Or, maybe you can
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone
else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else
so I can sleep at night
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone
else's life
Cry, cry
And I'm tired of letting someone
get the best of me,
so go ahead and
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin someone
else's—
