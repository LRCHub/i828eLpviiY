We are standing on the threshold
Of a decent conversation
When I can hear the door slam

I know the face you're making
And I really want to talk to you
I really, really wanted to
But once you get your mind made up
There is no getting through to you

For a while it was touching
For a while it was challenging
Before it became typical
And now it really isn't interesting
To see a grown man cry
To see a grown man cry

I'm lying on the sofa and the radio is blaring
And I'm scanning through the stations as the boys declare their feelings
But it doesn't feel like feelings
It feels like they're pretending
It's like they just want blowjobs
And they know these songs will get them

And I really want to talk to you
I really, really wanted to
But i have learned my lesson now
And you're not the one I'm turning to

And for a while it was touching
For a while it was challenging
Before it got habitual
And now it really isn't interesting
To see a grown man cry
To see a grown man cry

I was the first to warn you
I lay myself before you
I was the first to warn you
I put myself before you

We are standing on the corner
And you're throwing down the gauntlet
It is not a life decision
We just need to pick a restaurant

After all this, I should know you
Well enough not to get into it
I should learn, but I'm an idiot
You only want an argument

And for a while it was touching
It was almost even comforting
Before it became typical
And now it really is not interesting
To see a grown man cry
To see a grown man cry
To see a grown man throw a temper fit
To see a grown man cross his arms
And sit as if the whole wide world would end
If he was not a part of it
But at the same time with no confidence
Never realizing the consequence he's having
On the ones he loves
Because he thinks he makes no difference

We are standing on the threshold
Of a decent conversation
When I can hear the door slam
I know the face you're making
And I really want to talk to you
I really, really wanted to
But this time, I am giving up
I am simply giving up on you
