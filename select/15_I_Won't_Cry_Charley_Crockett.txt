If the water, water should run dry
All of my friends, they leave me here to die
That would be a hard fact baby, hard fact to deny
Oh but still, little darlin' I won't cry
I won't cry
If my brother, refused me at his door
And my lovin' mother, she don't want me anymore
I would have to ask myself, what are you livin' for?
But still, little darlin' I won't cry
I won't cry
If you ever wonder, bout the shape I'm in
Well you know I wonder, why you never come around here then?
The fate that I'm facing not like other men
Oh but still, little darlin' I won't cry
I won't cry
I won't cry
No I won't be afraid
No I won't shed a tear
No I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
