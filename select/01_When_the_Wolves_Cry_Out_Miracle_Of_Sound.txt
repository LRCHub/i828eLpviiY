When the wolves cry out
Echoes in the old walls
Distant are the calls
On the winter's wind
When the wolves cry out
Honour in the black bonds
Held in the beyond
As the lights they dim
Sometimes the last in line
Are the ones who last in time
Blood on the snow
Blood on the ashes
I'm not ashamed of what I am
Make it my own
Make it my castle
I'm not ashamed of what I am
Honour calls
Honour calls
Casting away the final mists of doubt...
When the wolves cry out
The smallest they will grow great
No more shall we wait
To rejoin the pack
They will heed my shout
So much have I lost here
Loves I held so dear
Taken by the black
Sometimes the lost bloodlines
Are the ones who last in time
Blood on the snow
Blood on the ashes
I'm not ashamed of what I am
Make it my own
Make it my castle
I'm not ashamed of what I am
Honour calls
Honour calls
Casting away the final mists of doubt...
When the wolves cry out
Breaking of the cycle
Thrones are ever idle
Winter on the walls
Grudges to be unlearned
Reach out to the unburnt
Flame to cover all
Blood on the snow
Blood on the ashes
I'm not ashamed of what I am
Make it my own
Make it my castle
I'm not ashamed of what I am
Honour calls
Honour calls
Casting away the final mists of doubt...
When the wolves cry out
Cry out
Breaking of the cycle
Thrones are ever idle
Winter on the walls
